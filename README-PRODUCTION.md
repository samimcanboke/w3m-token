## 🔒 Security Architecture

### Core Security Features

#### ✅ **Technical Safeguards**
- **Re-entrancy Protection**: `nonReentrant` on all state-changing functions
- **SafeERC20**: Secure token interactions for all external calls
- **Integer Overflow**: Solidity 0.8+ automatic protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking

#### ⏰ **Governance Safeguards**  
- **24-Hour Timelock**: All critical operations delayed for community review
- **Emergency Limits**: 5% daily maximum immediate withdrawal
- **Cooldown Periods**: Prevent rapid successive emergency actions
- **Minimum Reserve**: 20% of initial value always protected

#### 📊 **Economic Safeguards**
- **Price Mechanism**: Mathematically impossible to decrease
- **Supply Controls**: No arbitrary minting possible
- **Fee Structure**: Hardcoded and immutable distribution
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prevents front-running and manipulation

### Security Test Results

```
✅ Re-entrancy: PROTECTED
✅ Flash Loan Attacks: IMMUNE  
✅ Price Manipulation: IMPOSSIBLE
✅ Governance Abuse: LIMITED
✅ DoS Attacks: MITIGATED
✅ Integer Overflow: SAFE
```

### Foundry Unit Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

```

### Invariants Tested
1. Price never decreases to zero
2. USDC balance integrity maintained
3. Token supply within reasonable bounds
4. Pool count never exceeds limits
5. Minimum reserve always respected

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Timelock Management Interface

The React component provides:
- ⏰ **Real-time Timelock Tracking**: Monitor all scheduled operations
- 🔔 **Notification System**: Toast alerts for all timelock events
- ⚡ **One-Click Execution**: Execute operations after timelock expires
- 📊 **Status Dashboard**: Visual timeline of pending operations

```typescript
import { TimelockManager } from './components/TimelockManager';

<TimelockManager 
  contract={w3mContract}
  account={userAddress}
  isOwner={isContractOwner}
/>
```

### Integration Example
```typescript
// Schedule timelock operation
const scheduleEmergencyWithdraw = async (amount: string) => {
  try {
    const tx = await contract.emergencyWithdrawUSDC(
      ethers.utils.parseUnits(amount, 6), 
      true
    );
    // First call: schedules operation
    // Second call (after 24h): executes operation
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes("Operation scheduled")) {
      toast.success("Operation scheduled for 24h timelock!");
    }
  }
};
```

## 🏛️ Governance System  

### Current Phase: Centralized with Timelock Protection

#### Owner Powers (Timelock Protected)
- 🏦 **Emergency USDC Withdraw**: Large withdrawals with 24h delay
- 👥 **Pool Management**: Add/update reward pools  
- 💼 **Wallet Changes**: Modify fee distribution addresses

#### Owner Powers (Immediate, Limited)
- 📊 **Balance Sync**: Maintenance operations only
- 🚨 **Emergency Bypass**: Max 5% per day with 24h cooldown

#### Built-in Limitations
- ❌ **Cannot mint tokens**: Only buy/sell creates tokens
- ❌ **Cannot change fees**: Hardcoded distribution
- ❌ **Cannot pause trading**: No pause mechanism
- ❌ **Cannot access user funds**: Users control their tokens

### Future Phases

#### Phase 2: Multi-Sig (6-12 months)
- 👥 **3-of-5 Multi-Sig**: Distributed key control
- ⏰ **Enhanced Timelock**: Longer delays for major changes
- 🔑 **Community Signers**: Trusted community members

#### Phase 3: DAO Governance (12-24 months)  
- 🗳️ **Token Voting**: W3M holders vote on proposals
- 📝 **Proposal System**: Community-driven changes
- 🤖 **Automated Execution**: Trustless implementation

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Required variables:
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
NETWORK=sepolia|mainnet|polygon
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Main wallets
MAINNET_REFERRAL_WALLET=0x...
MAINNET_STAKING_WALLET=0x...
MAINNET_ACTIVE_USERS_WALLET=0x...

# Pool wallets (CRITICAL: Required for deployment)
MAINNET_LIQUIDITY_POOL_WALLET=0x...
MAINNET_DEVELOPMENT_WALLET=0x...
MAINNET_COMMUNITY_WALLET=0x...
```

### 🏊‍♂️ Pool System Architecture

**Why Pools Matter:**
Pools receive 2.5% of every token mint and must be configured at deployment to prevent token loss.

```
Every Buy Transaction:
├── 90.0% → User
├── 2.5% → Staking Rewards  
├── 2.5% → Pools (distributed by weight)
├── 2.0% → Referral/Marketing
└── 0.5% → Active Users

Pool Distribution (2.5% total):
├── 40% → Liquidity Pool (1.0% of total)
├── 30% → Development Fund (0.75% of total)  
└── 30% → Community Treasury (0.75% of total)
```

**Critical Deployment Requirement:**
- ⚠️ **Pools MUST be configured in constructor**
- ✅ **Token distribution works from first transaction**
- 🚫 **No "lost tokens" from early purchases**

### Network Configurations

#### Testnet Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with mock USDC and test setup
npm run deploy:testnet

# Automatically includes:
# - Mock USDC deployment
# - Test user creation with balances
# - Basic health checks
```

#### Mainnet Deployment
```bash
# Production deployment with verification
npm run deploy:mainnet

# Includes:
# - Real USDC integration
# - Contract verification on Etherscan
# - Production health checks
# - Deployment artifact saving
```

#### Multi-Chain Deployment
```bash
# Deploy on Polygon
NETWORK=polygon npm run deploy:mainnet

# Deploy on Arbitrum  
NETWORK=arbitrum npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### Post-Deployment Checklist
1. ✅ **Contract Verification**: Verify on block explorer
2. 🏊‍♂️ **Pool Verification**: Confirm pools are configured correctly
3. 🧪 **Basic Function Tests**: Buy/sell transactions with pool distribution
4. 📊 **Monitoring Setup**: Event tracking and alerts
5. 🎨 **Frontend Configuration**: Update contract addresses
6. 📢 **Community Announcement**: Inform users of deployment

### Pool Configuration Verification
```bash
# Verify pools are set up correctly
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "getPoolsCount()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "totalPoolWeight()" --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "pools(uint256)" 0 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDRESS "pools(uint256)" 1 --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```
